<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student pursuing dual degrees in Information Engineering and Public Administration at Shandong University. My research focuses on cutting-edge applications of Large Language Models in software engineering, including code translation, automated program repair, and commit message generation. I have led multiple research projects collaborating with Peking University's key laboratories and published in top-tier venues including IEEE TSE
